              'The twinkling of the what?' said the King. 'It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied. 'Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the King sharply. 'Do you  take me for a dunce? Go on!' 'I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, 'and most things twinkled after  that&mdash;only the March Hare said&mdash;' 'I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry. 'You did!' said the Hatter. 'I deny it!' said the March Hare. 'He denies it,' said the King: 'leave out that part.' 'Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said&mdash;' the Hatter went on, looking  anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied  nothing, being fast asleep. 'After that,' continued the Hatter, 'I cut some more bread-and-butter&mdash;' 'But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked. 'That I can't remember,' said the Hatter. 'You MUST remember,' remarked the King, 'or I'll have you executed.' The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went  down on one knee. 'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he began. 'You're a very poor speaker,' said the King. Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by  the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just  explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied  up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,  head first, and then sat upon it.)<br/>
              <br/>
              'I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice. 'I've so often read  in the newspapers, at the end of trials, "There was some attempts  at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the  court," and I never understood what it meant till now.' 'If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,' continued the  King. 'I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter: 'I'm on the floor, as it is.' 'Then you may SIT down,' the King replied. Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed. 'Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice. 'Now we shall get  on better.' 'I'd rather finish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the  Queen, who was reading the list of singers. 'You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,  without even waiting to put his shoes on. '&mdash;and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one of the  officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get  to the door. 'Call the next witness!' said the King. The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She carried the pepper-box in  her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the  court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once. 'Give your evidence,' said the King. 'Shan't,' said the cook. The King
